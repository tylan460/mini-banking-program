# mini-banking-program

A simple Java console-based banking program that allows users to check their balance, deposit money, withdraw money, and exit.

This project isn't all that, but i guess im just uploading it to github for the sake of building consistency with, well, uploading to github

i'll also be using my readme's as somewhat of a journal, so heads up
if this isn't best practice, well, eh.
